Hi, my name is Stephan Rasp. Currently, I am a PhD student at Ludwigs-Maximilians-University in Munich. My research deals with predictability of severe weather on the convective scale and the parameterization of turbulence and convection in atmospheric models. On this little website you can find out more about me and my research and check out my blog!
