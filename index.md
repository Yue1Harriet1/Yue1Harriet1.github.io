Hi, my name is Stephan Rasp. 

Currently, I am a PhD student at Ludwig-Maximilian-University in Munich. My research deals with the predictability of severe weather on the convective scale and the parameterization of turbulence and convection in atmospheric models. 

On this little website you can find out more [about me](https://raspstephan.github.io/cv/) and [my research](https://raspstephan.github.io/research/) or check out [my blog](https://raspstephan.github.io/blog/)!
