Hi, I'm Stephan. 

I am a PhD student at LMU Munich. My research is at the intersection of atmospheric modeling and machine learning. On this little website you can find out more about [me](https://raspstephan.github.io/cv/) and my research on [numerical weather prediction](https://raspstephan.github.io/weather_research/). I also [blog](https://raspstephan.github.io/blog/) on an irregular basis.

## Deep learning research

If you are interested in out recent work on using **deep learning for climate model parameterization**, check out these two papers:


Gentine, P., Pritchard, M., **Rasp, S.**, Reinaudi, G. and Yacalis, G., 2018. *Could machine learning break the convection parameterization deadlock?* Geophysical Research Letters. [https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078202](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL078202)


**Rasp, S.**, Pritchard, M. and Gentine, P., 2018. *Deep learning to represent sub-grid processes in climate models*. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04731](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04731)
