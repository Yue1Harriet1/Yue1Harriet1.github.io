Hi, I'm Stephan. 

I am a PhD student at LMU Munich with a focus on numerical weather prediction. I have also recently found a passion for deep learning and am tackling several problems in atmospheric science using neural networks. 

On this website you can read more [about me](https://raspstephan.github.io/cv/), [my weather research](https://raspstephan.github.io/weather_research/), [my deep learning research](https://raspstephan.github.io/dl_research/)  or check out [my blog](https://raspstephan.github.io/blog/)!
