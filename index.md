Hi, I'm Stephan. 

I am a PhD student at LMU Munich. My research is at the intersection of atmospheric modeling and machine learning. On this little website you can find out more about [me](https://raspstephan.github.io/cv/), my [machine learning projects](https://raspstephan.github.io/ml_research/) and my research on [numerical weather prediction](https://raspstephan.github.io/weather_research/). I also [blog](https://raspstephan.github.io/blog/) on an irregular basis.

If you are interested in out recent work on using neural networks for climate model parameterization, check out this blog post (coming soon) for a summary.
